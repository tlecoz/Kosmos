# Kosmos_JAVA

an old project... 

It's a framework based on Processing very inspired by Flash/Actionscript.

It reproduce every functions of Processing with an object oriented structure (contrary to Processing who do everything in the same object)

It handle 2D rendering , 3D rendering , OOP-shader creation and Box2D integration (physic engine) as a whole part of the framework.

I stopped it because I almost finished it when Processing 3 came out ; some part of the code are not compatible and I jumped into javascript / webgl at this time ; it works well with eclipse and the last version of Processing2 for eclipse
